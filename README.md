# POMDP Experiments

These experiments investigate the difficulty of extracting transition probabilities in a POMDP setting using histories of varying lengths ($h$). We measure the "Sample Complexity"—the number of total episodes required to achieve a valid trial for a specific history.

Tested configurations:

{ "name": "POMDP-10", "states": 10, "obs": 6, "actions": 3, "target_ent": (0.9, 0.95), "p_move": 0.7, "p_random": 0.5 },
{ "name": "POMDP-20", "states": 20, "obs": 13, "actions": 3, "target_ent": (0.9, 0.95), "p_move": 0.7, "p_random": 0.5 }
